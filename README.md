In this work, we showed that it is possible to predict the test result for SARS-CoV-2 based on the results of laboratory tests commonly collected for a suspected COVID-19 case by analyzing a sample of 5644 patients of which 558 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein.
